README (tree_routing_test_pc)
=============================

Compile: make clean && make

Run: ./tree_routing_test_pc.exe -n <sos_server_ip:port>

Description:
This tool connects to the sossrv program and monitors the packets coming
into the PC from the sensor network.
If the packet is dispatched using the tree routing protocol, then the
tool processes the packet and maintains statistics of packets received.
For each node it maintains three bits of information:
1. Number of packets received from that node.
2. Number of packets missed from that node (These could be lost in the nw)
3. Sequence no. of the last packet received from the node.
