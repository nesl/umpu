README for Loader Debug
-----------------------
This application can be used to debug the loader.
Setup requires three motes: MoteA, MoteB, MoteSnoop.
1. MoteA is attached to the PC.
2. MoteB is one-hop away from MoteA.
3. MoteSnoop is also attached to the PC (on a different serial port than MoteA).


Installation
-------------
1. Install the blank SOS kernel on MoteA and MoteB.
2. Install RadioSnoop_App on MoteSnoop.
3. Start two instances of sos_server as follows:
   a) ./sos_server -s <serial_device_for_MoteA>
   b) ./sos_server -s <serial_device_for_MoteSnoop> -p <Snoop_Server_Port>
4. Start loader_snoop with the port address set to Snoop_Server_Port
5. Use the sos_tool to install modules on the network and observer the messages sent over the air.
