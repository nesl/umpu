\section{Control Flow Manager}
\label{sec:cfmgr}
%
Programming errors can cause a module to corrupt its own state, even with
protection domains.
%
%% The protection domains cannot
%% prevent such internal memory corruption.
%
Unfortunately, a user module's control flow might be affected by internal memory
corruption.
%
For example, function pointers (commonly used to implement callbacks)
are stored in RAM.
%
Return addresses to function call sites are stored in stack.
%
Corruption of these values might cause the processor to execute
arbitrary code, including the memory map API,
%
violating one of the requirements of using the memory map for
protection.
%% ; restricting memory map access to single trusted domain
%% (Refer Section~\ref{subsec:mmap_for_protection}).
%
The \emph{control flow manager} ensures that control can never flow out of
a domain except via calls to functions exported by the kernel or modules in
other domains, and via the corresponding returns.
%
Conversely, control flow can enter a domain only through an exported
function or through the return site of a call that was made to a
function exported by some other domain.
%
The control flow manager also tracks the identity of the currently
executing domain.
%
This information is required by the memory map checker to validate write
accesses.
%
Harbor's \emph{cross domain call} mechanism is used
to transfer control safely from a caller to a callee domain.
%
A corresponding \emph{cross domain return} mechanism restores control back to
a caller domain. 
%
Control flow integrity within a domain is preserved through a \emph{safe stack}
that stores return addresses.
%
%==============================================================================
% CROSS DOMAIN CALL
%=============================================================================
\subsection{Cross Domain Call}
\label{sec:crossdomcall}
%
%All function calls made across domains pass through a \textit{cross domain call stub}.
%
%Four operations are performed by the cross domain call stub.
%
%
A cross domain call performs four operations.
%
First, it verifies the call's target address, which
%
should match the address of a function officially \emph{exported} by some
module or the kernel.
%
Second, it saves the caller's domain identity and return address.
%
Third, it sets up a \emph{stack bound}, which prevents the callee from
modifying portions of the stack belonging to the caller.
%
Finally, it jumps to the callee.
%
%% Stack bound is required for run-time stack protection (Section~\ref{subsec:stackguard}).
%
The cross domain call mechanism tries to optimize the performance of these operations.
%

   domain}
   \label{fig:cross_domain_call}
\end{figure}


%
Call address verification is accomplished with the help of a \emph{jump
table}, an extra level of indirection in cross-domain function calls.
%
%% This simplifies the verification of call target addresses
%% and eases the tracking of the system's currently active domain.
%
Modules in a domain are linked with modules in other domains at
load-time as described in Section~\ref{sec:soslinking}.
%
A linker running on the sensor node parses the module's exported functions
and writes them to the jump table.
%
The jump table, which is stored in flash memory, is similar in design
to an interrupt vector table.
%
Each jump table entry is an instruction to jump to an exported
function;
%
the function's address is encoded within the instruction stream.
%
Each domain has its own jump table, containing all the functions exported
by modules in that domain (or, for the kernel domain, all functions
exported by the kernel).
%
Since modules cannot directly write to flash memory, they cannot
corrupt the jump table.
%
Modules that subscribe to functions exported by a particular module
are redirected through the corresponding domain's jump table.
%
This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:cross_domain_call}.
%
The jump table mechanism is independent of the process used for
dynamic linking (exporting and subscribing to functions), which might use
several other techniques~\cite{dunkels06linking}.
%

Each domain is currently allocated one page of internal flash memory for
storing its jump table.
%
%%%% XXX EDDIE STOPS HERE
%
In the AVR architecture, this imposes a limit of 64 exported functions per
domain.
%
The SOS kernel domain exports the system call API that consists of 32
functions.
%
SOS module currently export up to a maximum of 12 functions, allowing
at least 5 modules to share a domain.
%
Empty entries in the jump table are filled with a jump instruction to an
exception routine.
%
All domains' jump table pages are stored contiguously in flash memory,
reducing the overhead of verifying a call's target address and domain.



All function calls made across modules need to pass through a
\textit{cross domain call stub}.
%
This stub, a part of the Harbor runtime, is located
in a trusted region of program memory.
%
In SOS, cross module calls use a macro \texttt{SOS\_CALL};
%
we modified its implementation to force
a call into the cross domain call stub.
%
This is implemented as an assembly routine
within the SOS kernel, with pseudocode
%
shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:cross_domain_call_stub}.

  \caption{Pseudocode of Cross Domain Call Stub}
  \label{fig:cross_domain_call_stub}
\end{figure}
%

The stub first stores the return address in the safe stack (Section~\ref{subsec:safe_stack}).
%
%% The design of safe stack is described later in
%% Section~\ref{subsec:safe_stack}.
%
All valid cross-module calls must have target addresses that reside in the
jump table, since
%
modules subscribe to jump table locations
corresponding to the functions exported by other modules.
%
A call into the jump table is checked by a simple compare operation to
the base address of jump table.
%
%% Check against the upper bound of jump table is deferred.
%
The stub then stores the current domain identifier and the stack bound
in the safe stack.
%
A store into the stack is required because cross domain calls can be
chained: domain A calls domain B, which in turn calls domain C.
%
Next, the identity of the callee domain is computed by determining
the jump table page in which the target address falls.
%
%% Jump tables of all domains are organized linearly, starting from the
%% domain 0 jump table located at the base address.
%% %
%% The identifier of target domain can be easily determined by first
%% computing the address offset from the base address of jump table and
%% dividing it by the size of jump table.
%
If the target domain identifier exceeds the maximum number of domains
in the system, then the target address is greater
than the upper bound of jump table; an exception is generated.
%
The callee domain may equal the current domain when a module transfers
control to another module in the same domain.
%
The cross domain return address is pushed to the safe stack, ensuring that
%
control flow will return to the stub.
%
Finally, a call is made into the jump table, which redirects it to the
actual entry point in the target domain.
%
During cross domain return, the previous domain identifier and stack
bound are restored and the control is transferred back to caller
domain.
%

As all domains share a common run-time stack, the cross
domain call stub does not need to copy call arguments.
%
Further, no modifications are made to any data frames set up in the run-time
stack during function calls.
%
Therefore, a single cross domain call and return stub suffices for
all cross domain calls, unlike the per-function stub required by the
original SFI~\cite{wahbe93sfi}.
%
The implementation of the cross domain call stub only uses the
caller-saved registers described by the \texttt{avr-gcc} ABI.
%

Harbor currently disallows all computed branches except for cross
module calls.  This ensures that applications cannot avoid memory and/or
control flow checks, but also prevents certain implementations of control
flow structures like \texttt{switch}.


%==============================================================================
% STACK PROTECTION
%==============================================================================
\subsection{Run-Time Stack Protection}
\label{subsec:stackguard}
%
%% Micro-controllers have a single address space and therefore the
%% run-time stack is shared by entire system.
%% %
%% In most architectures, stack is initialized at the end of address
%% space and grows down towards the start of address space.
%% %
%% Run-time stack is used for many purposes.
%% %
%% First, it is used to record return addresses of function calls.
%% %
%% Second, it is used to set up data frames for storing local variables
%% or function arguments that cannot be accommodated in registers.
%% %
%% Third, it is also used to store arguments for variadic functions.
%% %

Harbor shares a common run-time stack across all domains.
%
The design alternative, allocating a private stack per domain,
%
would require too much memory, since stack memory must be allocated
conservatively (the stack can grow significantly during execution).
%
%% Therefore, this design is not feasible on micro-controllers.
%
%% However, stack corruption is a serious problem when it is shared
%% across domains.
%
Harbor implements a \emph{stack bound} to prevent one domain from
corrupting another domain's local variables and other stack
information.
%
The cross domain call stub sets up a stack bound before transferring
control, and the cross domain return stub restores the previous stack
bound.
%
The stack bound is set to the beginning of the callee frame as shown
in the Figure~\ref{fig:stackbound}.
%
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:checker}, the stack access checker is invoked
for writes to the run-time stack, a statically allocated region of memory
at the high end of the address space.
%
Harbor disallows writes to memory addresses greater than the current stack
bound (assuming a stack that grows down).
%
%% The stack access checker compares the write address to the current stack
%% bound and signals an exception if the address exceeds the stack bound.
%
%% Therefore, a module cannot corrupt the stack belonging to another domain.
%
%% As mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:cdc}, the current stack bound is
%% updated by the cross domain call and return stubs.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[height=2.0in, keepaspectratio=true]{figures/stack_bounds.eps} 
   \caption[Run-time stack protection using stack bounds]{Run-time stack protection using stack bounds. All writes
     above the current stack bound are disallowed.}
   \label{fig:stackbound}
\end{figure}


The stack bound does prevent cross domain data sharing through the stack,
but we have never encountered an instance of such sharing
in the SOS system.
%


%=============================================================================
% SAFE STACK
%==============================================================================
\subsection{Safe Stack}
\label{subsec:safe_stack}
%
Correct fault isolation requires that Harbor limit control flow
\emph{within} modules, as well as across modules.
%
A module must not be able to jump into its code arbitrarily, since this
might allow it to avoid a run-time check.
%
The Harbor runtime therefore uses an additional \emph{safe stack}
to preserve the integrity of control flow within and across modules.
%
The safe stack resides in the
trusted domain, preventing any corruption by application wild writes.
%
%% This prevents any corruption to the safe stack caused due to wild
%% writes.
%
%% Only the code executing in the trusted domain can access the safe
%% stack.
%
Harbor stores function calls' return addresses on the safe stack,
protecting them from wild writes by applications in any domain
(Figure~\ref{fig:safestack}).
%
The cross domain call stub also uses the safe stack to store the current
domain ID and run-time stack bound.
%
The safe stack pointer is maintained as a global variable, and manipulated
by sequences of push and pop operations.
%%  is read
%% (and written) before (and after) a sequence of push/pop operations. 
%
%% A module can call any local function within its domain.
%
%% The return addresses of function calls are stored in the run-stack and are
%% protected from corruption from modules in other domains.
%
%% However, a programming error can cause a module to corrupt its own
%% run-time stack.
%
%% This cannot be prevented by protection domains.
%
%% Executing the return instruction on the corrupted run-time stack can cause the
%% control flow to become unpredictable.
%
%% Therefore, Harbor stores all return addresses within the safe stack.
%
A function entry stub, \texttt{func\_entry\_stub}, copies the return
address from the run-time stack onto the safe stack.
%
Similarly, \texttt{func\_exit\_stub} pops the return address from
the safe stack and restores the run-time stack.
%
The entry and exit points of every local function within a domain are
rewritten to invoke these stub routines.
% in the trusted domain that pushes
%(and pops) return addresses into the Safe Stack.
%
%
%Safe Stack is used to overwrite return address values in run-time
%stack.
%
We do not modify the run-time stack in any manner as this would corrupt data
frames setup by functions for storing local data and function
arguments.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=5.3in, keepaspectratio=true]{figures/safe_stack.eps} 
   \caption[Using safe stack for storing return address]{Using safe
     stack for storing return address (1) All calls are redirected

     redirected into the \texttt{func\_exit\_stub} (4) The stub
     restores copied return address from safe stack to run-time stack}
   \label{fig:safestack}
\end{figure}

The safe stack can be placed anywhere in data memory as long as it is
protected from accidental writes and overflow.
%
We usually place the safe stack at the end of all global data in the
system and make it grow upwards.
%
The run-time stack and safe stack thus approach one another.
%
%Therefore, all return addresses are checked.
%
%Domains occupy contiguous portions in program memory. 
%
%When the domain is loaded into a system, the Control flow manager records its start and end addresses.
%
%Return addresses are checked to ensure that they lie within bounds of the current domain; else an exception is raised.
%
%Similarly, all computed call addresses are also subject to an identical bounds check.
%
%Calls to static addresses are verified at load time.
%
%All checks are introduced through a binary rewriter.
