\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%
This paper explores the challenges in providing fault isolation
through memory protection on resource constrained embedded systems
such as sensor nodes.
%
Sensor networks have promise for many industrial, commercial, and
medical applications.
%
For example, CodeBlue~\cite{welsh04codeblue} is a prototype medical
sensor network platform for expediting triage during disaster
response.
%
A network of 4000 sensors deployed by Intel in a
semiconductor fabrication plant performs predictive maintenance of
machinery in service~\cite{intel05fabapp}.
%
The Zigbee consortium~\cite{zigbee} seeks to equip lighting and
HVAC controllers with wireless radios, enabling intelligent building
automation and security services.
%
These current and upcoming sensor network deployments require high
availability infrastructure with the ability to support multiple users.
%
%
Unexpected system failures could cause problems ranging from financial
impacts to loss of life.
%
Current software technology is grossly inadequate to run such long
term deployments.
%
Bugs in any part of the software can easily bring down an entire network.
%
In particular, memory corruption due to buggy applications can crash or
freeze sensor nodes or corrupt sensed data.
%
We argue that memory protection is a vital enabling technology for
creating reliable and long-lasting sensor network software systems.
%

Sensor software is quite complex, supporting 
%
many sensor types, multiple distributed
middleware services, dynamic code updates, and concurrent applications.
%
Programmers must deal with severe resource constraints and concurrency issues
%
on hardware with very limited debugging support.
%
Therefore, programming errors are quite common and can impact the network.


Mote-class sensor nodes~\cite{jasonhillthesis} have a very simple architecture.
%
All primary memory is accessible to all programs running
on a node via a single address space.
%
Common mote-class architectures do not have features such as memory
management units (MMUs) and privileged-mode execution used in
desktop/server class systems to isolate program data and code.
%
Embedded microcontroller designers face extreme pressure to minimize chip cost and area.
%
Sometimes even 32-bit ARM processor cores omit an MMU to minimize system cost and power~\cite{arm7tdmi}.
%
We expect MMU designs will continue to be absent from low-cost low-power
microcontrollers.
%
Therefore, there is a need for new advancements in software and architecture
technology to make robust sensor node applications.
%
%==================================================================
\subsection{Memory Protection in Embedded Sensor Systems}
%
Software-based approaches for memory protection have emerged to
compensate for the architectural limitations of embedded
microcontrollers.
%
Domain specific interpreters such as Mat\'e~\cite{asvm05nsdi} provide
a safe environment to execute high-level application scripts.
%
Type-safe languages such as Virgil~\cite{titzer06virgil} provide
fine-grained protection of individual memory objects.
%
However, these approaches have their limitations.
%
For example, Mat\'e instructions are implemented in non type-safe
language and could be buggy.
%
Type-safe languages require unsafe extensions to interface to the
low-level hardware, though these extensions could be used sparingly.
%
An ideal system for memory protection might combine two or
more software-based approaches.
%


In this paper, we present \emph{Harbor}, a system for providing
%software-based 
coarse-grained memory protection in resource-%
constrained embedded sensor nodes.
%
Harbor can be used as a building block with other approaches to create
more effective protection mechanisms.
%
For instance, Harbor can be used to implement memory safe Mat\'e
instructions.
%
Harbor partitions a sensor node's memory into
multiple \textit{domains}.
%
Memory belonging to one domain is protected from corruption by code running
in other domains.
%
We achieve memory protection by enforcing restrictions on memory accesses.
%
In this paper, we have designed two systems that introduce these restrictions.
%
The first system re-writes machine instructions of a compiled binary.
%
This software only technique, first proposed by Wahbe et
al.~\cite{wahbe93sfi}, is known as software-based fault isolation,
SFI, or ``sandboxing''.
%
The second system modifies the processor architecture to enforce memory
access restrictions and is applicable to system-on-chip embedded
systems using processor cores.
%

%==================================================================
\subsection{Contributions of the Paper}
%
We improve the reliability of embedded sensor software by isolating
the domains from one another.
%
This paper investigates the challenges in implementing fault isolation
on resource-constrained embedded sensor nodes.
%
Scarce memory resources require Harbor to have a very small memory
footprint.
%
Limited computational capabilities also encouraged us to limit Harbor's
CPU overhead.
%
The contribution of our work has been to design techniques that make
sandboxing feasible on embedded sensor nodes despite these
constraints.
%
In particular, these techniques are:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item{A \emph{Memory map} data structure that efficiently maintains
fine-grained ownership and layout information for the entire address
space.
%
Motes' limited address space precludes static address space
partitioning: there is not enough memory available to assign each
domain a single contiguous range of addresses.
%
The memory map can be tuned to match available resources and protection
requirements.
%
}
%
\item{A \textit{Safe stack} in protected memory preserves control flow
integrity~\cite{xfi06osdi} within a domain by storing function return addresses.
%
The conventional run-time stack, which stores local data, function
parameters, and so forth and is shared by all the domains, is
protected from corruption via \emph{stack bounds}.
%
The alternative of maintaining a separate stack per
domain is not desirable due to address space limitations.
%
}
%
\item{\textit{Cross domain calls} implement low-overhead
context switches between domains.
%
The overhead of copying call arguments is eliminated as the domains
share a common run-time stack.
%
Cross domain calls and returns track the system's currently active domain.
%
}
%
\item{\textit{Run-time checks} ensure that control flow in and out
of a domain occur as expected even on computed transfers, and
similarly that memory is accessed only as expected.
%
}
%
\end{itemize}

%Figure~\ref{fig:sys_comp} presents the components of the Harbor memory
%protection system and the interactions between them.
%
These techniques are easily incorporated into existing systems.
%
We have designed and evaluated two systems that use the Harbor fault isolation
techniques.
%
Our experiments show that memory protection through fault isolation is
feasible on resource constrained sensor nodes.

\subsection{Applications of Harbor Memory Protection}
%
\subsubsection{Memory Protection in SOS Operating System}
%
SOS~\cite{ram05sos} is an operating system for sensor nodes in which a
statically compiled kernel is installed on the node, and application
level functionality is implemented by a set of dynamically loadable
binary modules.
%
We use Harbor memory protection to isolate binary modules running
on SOS.
%
Run-time checks are introduced in a SOS module by a \emph{binary rewriter} and
verified independently by a \emph{verifier} running on every sensor
node.
%
To minimize the module code size, the run-time checks are not inlined.
%
Modules invoke the run-time checks by calling or jumping into the
appropriate routines located in the trusted domain (the SOS kernel).
%
%% Thus, it is not possible to circumvent checks as 
All potentially unsafe operations such as stores to memory are replaced
by calls to corresponding checks.
%
%Calls to the checks are introduced by a \emph{binary rewriter} and verified
%independently by a \emph{verifier} running on every sensor node.
%
Harbor's correctness depends only upon the correctness of the
verifier and the Harbor runtime, and not on the rewriter.
%
%The design of the verifier affects the system's performance
%(Section~\ref{sec:writeverify}).
%
%So far, we have only 
We have designed a simple verifier that requires constant state
information for a binary.
%
%Exploring the design space of verifiers and evaluating their impact on
%performance is a challenge that remains to be addressed.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Micro Memory Protection Unit}
%
We design a Micro Memory Protection Unit (UMPU) by partitioning the
Harbor Memory Protection system into hardware and software components.
%
UMPU was implemented on the AVR~\cite{avrdatasheet} microcontroller and
its performance was evaluated by executing complex software systems
such as SOS.
%
The careful hardware software co-design of UMPU results in significant
performance improvement over a software-only implementation with minimal
increase to the area and cost of AVR.
%
AVR enhanced with UMPU extensions is instruction set compatible with
regular AVR microcontrollers.
%
This design feature has practical value, as the existing
toolchains for the AVR architecture can be used with UMPU.
%
%
%An additional benefit of UMPU is that it eliminates the binary
%rewriting required by the software-only implementation that can be
%error-prone.
%

Harbor protection mechanism can be applied in general to a large class
of resource constrained embedded systems.
%
In this paper, we will focus primarily on the application of Harbor
protection to embedded sensor networks.
%
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
\subsection{Robust Embedded Software}
%
During experimentation, Harbor detected memory corruption in a data
collection application module that had been in use for several months.
%
A common programming mistake in SOS is to forget to check the error code
returned by a cross-domain function call.
%
In the Surge data collection module~\cite{woo03surge}, under certain
conditions, the invalid result of a failed function call to the Tree
routing module was being used to determine an offset into a buffer.
%
Subsequently, the data was being written to an incorrect memory
location, which would cause some of the nodes in the network to crash.
%
Harbor was successfully able to prevent the corruption and signal the
invalid access.
%


The cross-domain function call described above fails under the rare
condition when the Surge module is loaded on a node before the Tree
routing module.
%
Such conditions can be easily missed during software testing.
%
However, during deployments, the errors caused due to such failures
can have a severe impact on the network.
%
A system that can guarantee memory protection is indispensable for
building robust embedded software.
