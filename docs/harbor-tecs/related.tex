\section{Related Work and Background}
\label{sec:related}
%
This section reviews other systems that provide memory protection.
%
The systems are broadly classified based on their application
domains.
%
We focus first on sensor networks and then survey the more general
space of desktop and server computing systems.
%
%We conclude this section with a brief overview of SOS operating system.
%
%=====================================================================
\subsection{Sensor Networks}
%
As sensor networks are envisioned for long-term deployments, several
projects have addressed reliability as a primary design
concern~\cite{tkernel06sensys,regehr06utos,dutta05ipsn}.
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Naturalization --- \emph{t-kernel}}
%
\emph{t-kernel}~\cite{tkernel06sensys}, a runtime for Mica motes, also
rewrites binaries to make them safe for execution.
%
Harbor and \emph{t-kernel} represent different points in the design space of
software-based protection mechanisms.
%
\emph{t-kernel} enforces a strong isolation boundary between the application and
the kernel.
%
Through a process called \emph{naturalization}, the application binary is
rewritten on the sensor node to guarantee that the \emph{t-kernel} can
always safely regain control of the processor, even, for example, in the
presence of application infinite loops that could otherwise hang the
system.
%
The rewritten application binary contains an entire TinyOS operating system
image, in contrast to Harbor, where multiple modules within an
application are prevented from corrupting one another.
%


\emph{t-kernel} also implements software-based differentiated
virtual memory,
%
which translates the addresses for all memory accesses made by a program
into the heap segment.
%
The overhead of virtual memory is unpredictable and can be very
high in the event of a swap from external flash.
%
Harbor does not implement virtual memory, but does enforce memory isolation at a
finer granularity than \emph{t-kernel}.
%
In particular, Harbor can protect application modules from
one another.
%

Harbor does not address control flow isolation, except as required to
enforce memory isolation; in particular, it cannot force a buggy module
stuck in an infinite loop to relinquish control of the CPU.
%
\emph{t-kernel} requires external flash memory, whereas Harbor makes use of
on-chip flash memory only.
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Safe OS Extensions --- UTOS}
%
Safe TinyOS~\cite{regehr06utos} uses CCured~\cite{ccured02necula} and static
analysis techniques to provide memory safety for TinyOS applications.
%
CCured performs complex pointer analysis to mark pointers as safe or
unsafe.
%
Much driver code performs arbitrary typecasts that can cause CCured to
fail or conservatively mark pointers as unsafe, which introduces a
performance penalty as the CCured run-time performs bounds checks on
unsafe pointers during code execution.
%
CCured provides memory safety at a much finer granularity than Harbor.
%

The UTOS framework allows untrusted extensions to
safely interface with Safe TinyOS components.
%
UTOS extensions are made type-safe and memory-safe using CCured and a
backend service that copies buffers when they are exchanged between the
extension and the Safe TinyOS core.
%
Extensions are not allowed to interact with one another.
%
Harbor allows safe buffer transfers without copying, and allows extensions
to interact, but its current simple runtime check infrastructure introduces
overhead that CCured can sometimes avoid.
%

The UTOS backend service also mediates resource requests and prevents any
extension from starving other extensions in the system.
%
Harbor does not make any guarantees on fair resource allocation.
%
%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Application Specific Virtual Machines --- Mat\'e}
%
Application Specific Virtual Machines (ASVM) such as
Mat\'e~\cite{asvm05nsdi}~\cite{levis02mate} and
Agilla~\cite{agilla05ipsn} are domain specific interpreters that
execute high-level application scripts.
%
Both Harbor and ASVMs provide memory safety to applications, albeit
through different mechanisms.
%
Harbor isolates applications from one another.
%
ASVM performs type and bounds checks on all memory accesses.
%
ASVM's checks are in some ways more stringent than Harbor's protection,
since the type safety of the instruction set also prevent scripts from
corrupting \emph{their own} memory.
%
However, errors in ASVM's native code implementation might corrupt any
memory on the node.
%
Further, for efficiency, ASVMs are designed to be easily extensible to
customize the interpreters for a specific application domain.
%
The extensions can also be introduced dynamically~\cite{balani06dvm}.
%
The ASVM extensions implement powerful high level opcodes that perform
complex operations.
%
The extensions are implemented in non-type safe languages and can be
buggy.
%
ASVMs could thus use Harbor's isolation to become more robust to errors in
extensions.


The trade-offs between ASVMs and Harbor are evaluated in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:eval}.
%
Harbor has a significantly lower execution overhead compared than ASVM,
%
but its run-time checks 
%introduced by Harbor 
increase code size.
%
%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Type Safe Languages --- Virgil}
%
Type-safe languages provide memory safety at a fine granularity.
%
Type-safe languages for resource constrained microcontrollers is an
emerging area of research.
%
Most of the software developed for embedded systems is written in
unsafe languages such as C (or even assembly for low-level drivers). 
%
%The popular sensor network programming language NesC~\cite{gay03nesc}
%contains minimal extensions to C (such as the \texttt{atomic} keyword)
%to prevent race conditions.
%
%However, it does not address memory safety.


A common criticism of safe languages or unsafe languages retrofitted
with type information~\cite{ccured02necula} is their excessive CPU and
memory consumption.
%
This often makes them unsuitable for resource constrained sensor
nodes.
%
Virgil~\cite{titzer06virgil} is a new programming language that
attempts to address some of these concerns.
%
By explicitly separating initialization time from run time, Virgil
allows an application to build complex data structures during
compilation and then run directly on bare hardware without a virtual
machine or a language run time.
%
The separation allows the entire program heap to be available at
compile time and enables new optimizations that reduce memory size.
%
Virgil does not support dynamic memory allocation.
%
Therefore, it is currently suited for building application specific
static operating system images such as TinyOS~\cite{levis05t2}.
%
An interesting area of future research is to explore safe languages
(such as Virgil) as a primary extensibility mechanism for dynamic
sensor operating systems such as SOS~\cite{ram05sos}.
%
%SPIN project~\cite{spin95sosp} at University of Washington explored
%safe languages as the primiary extensibility mechanism in desktop
%operating systems.

Finally, a safe language restricts an implementation to a single
language; it ignores a large base of existing code.
%
Harbor operates on compiled binaries and is therefore independent of
any programming language and is applicable to all existing code.
%
Type safe languages require unsafe extensions to interface to
low-level hardware\footnote{Virgil extends type safety to the
  hardware}, though these extensions could be used sparingly.
%
Another problem with type-safe languages is the size of the system
that needs to be trusted.
%
A complete language compiler and run-time consists of an optimizer
that uses complex analysis to improve run-time efficiency.
%
This is a large and complicated code base, all of which needs to be
trusted.
%
In contrast, for Harbor, only the run-time components and the simple
verifier needs to be trusted.
%
The size of this system is considerably smaller than the size of a
compiler.
%
% VM*~\cite{vmstar05sensys} is a virtual machine construction kit
% targets resource constrained sensor nodes and supports a subset of the
% JAVA programming language.
% %
% The VM* framework automatically generates an application specific
% virtual machine.
% %
% The virtual machine is optimized to include only parts of the
% interpreter and the run-time that are needed.
% %
% A native API exposes the OS and hardware services to the JAVA
% applications.
% %
% VM* addresses the development of applications in JAVA but the
% underlying operating system and device drivers are still written in
% non type-safe languages such as C or assembly.
% %
% JAVA applications in VM* are type-safe.
% %
% Unlike Harbor and UTOS, the VM* applications are not isolated from the
% operating system.
%
%Sympathy, a debugging framework, has focussed on developing
%network-level protocols to diagnose/localize
%problems~\cite{nithya05sympathy} 
%
%We can leverage Sympathy framework to send diagnostic information to
%the basestation whenever an exception is triggered in Harbor
%
%At present, hardware support in sensor nodes to achieve high
%dependability is absent, with reboot of the entire node being the
%most common approach~\cite{dutta05ipsn}.
%
%

Recently, RETOS operating system~\cite{retos07spots}, also provides
memory protection for applications through a rewrite of compiled binary.

%=========================================================================
\subsection{Software-based Techniques}
%
The design considerations for an embedded sensor system are vastly
different from a desktop/server system.
%
Still, some of the features in Harbor have been motivated from the
large range of software-based memory protection techniques proposed
for desktop/server systems.
%
%------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Software-based Fault Isolation (SFI)}
\label{subsec:sfi}
%
Software-based Fault Isolation (SFI) is a general technique that
restricts the address range of stores, jumps and calls by modifying a
program binary.
%
The key challenge to SFI is to introduce the restrictions efficiently, and in
a manner that they cannot be bypassed by maliciously designed input
code.
%
SFI was originally proposed by Wahbe et al.~\cite{wahbe93sfi} (called
``sandboxing'').
%
%The pseudocode to sandbox an address is explained in
%Figure~\ref{fig:sbxpseudocode}.
%
%
% \begin{figure}
%  \begin{tabbing}
%   \texttt{dedi}\=\texttt{cated-reg} $\Leftarrow$ \texttt{target-reg \&
%     and-mask-reg} \\
%   \>\emph{Use dedicated register} \texttt{and-mask-reg} \emph{to clear
%     segment identifier bits.}\\
%   \texttt{dedicated-reg} $\Leftarrow$ \texttt{target-reg |
%     segment-reg} \\
%   \>\emph{Use dedicated register} \texttt{segment-reg} \emph{to set
%     segment identifier bits.}\\
%   \texttt{store instruction uses dedicated-reg}
%  \end{tabbing}
%  \caption{Assembly pseudo code to sandbox address in
%    \texttt{target-addr}}
%  \label{fig:sbxpseudocode}
% \end{figure}
% %

Sandboxing enforces static partitioning on an application's virtual address
space to enable safe sharing of the address space by multiple
cooperative modules.
%
By choosing address space boundaries to be powers of 2, sandboxing
restrictions are efficiently introduced through bit-masks.
%
%Specifically, the target address of a store instruction is forced to belong to its domain.
%
Dedicated registers guarantee that checks cannot be bypassed by
jumping into the middle of a sandbox sequence.
%
In addition, Wahbe et al. also designed a low-latency
cross-fault-domain communication mechanism.
%

Harbor strives to enforce similar restrictions as SFI; it disallows
stores and jumps to addresses outside the module's domain.
%
However, the architectural limitations of the embedded processors
motivate new design approaches.
%
First, the absence of virtual memory in embedded processors limits the
total address space to the available physical memory.
%
The on-chip SRAM in AVR microcontroller~\cite{avrdatasheet} is a meagre 4 Kb.
%
Therefore, static partitioning of the physical memory address space is
infeasible; it would lead to excessive internal fragmentation of the
limited memory.
%
Second, all software domains on an embedded processor share a
common run-time stack.
%
SFI implementations for desktop processors set up a separate stack for
each domain within their allocated address space.
%
Protecting the shared run-time stack is a design challenge for Harbor.
%
Third, the instruction set architectures of embedded processors have
limited capabilities.
%
For instance, in AVR, the load and store operations can use only three
pairs of registers for addressing.
%
Therefore, it is often infeasible to set aside a dedicated register
pair for sandboxing.
%
Techniques different from SFI have to be employed to ensure that
Harbor checks are not circumvented.
%
Fourth, there is no support for privileged instructions in an embedded
processor.
%
Since embedded software runs directly ``on metal'', therefore Harbor
has to detect and disallow certain potentially unsafe opcodes, such
as store to program memory.
%


Many variations of SFI have emerged since Wahbe's original
implementation of this technique for the two RISC architectures, MIPS
and Alpha.
%
In particular, the x86 implementations of SFI also face one similar
constraint as Harbor, namely the lack of sufficient registers in the
architecture to set aside a dedicated register.
%
MiSFIT~\cite{small97misfit}, an assembly language re-writer designed
to isolated faults in C++ code written for an extensible operating
system, uses a hash table of legal jump targets.
%
Control flow is re-directed through a check that ensures that jump
targets appear in the hash table.
%
This eliminates the need for dedicated registers.
%
PittSFIeld~\cite{pittsfield} divides the program memory into chunks of
16 bytes\footnote{Any size that is a power of 2 would suffice.} and
ensures through padding with \texttt{NOPS} that control flow does not
change except at an entry or exit of a chunk boundary.
%
The sandboxing sequence is inserted entirely within a chunk and
therefore cannot be circumvented.


\subsubsection{Control Flow Integrity (CFI)}
%
A Control Flow Integrity (CFI)~\cite{cfi05msr} policy dictates that
software execution must follow the path of a \emph{control flow graph}
(CFG) determined ahead of time.
%
CFI has more general goals than SFI, which focuses solely on restricting a
program's jumps.
%
CFI is implemented by labelling each potential jump target by a
uniquely encoded tag symbol.\footnote{Tag symbol is decoded as
  \texttt{NOP}.}
%
All computed control transfers check for the appropriate tag before
transferring control.
%
XFI~\cite{xfi06osdi} builds on CFI to offer a
flexible, generalized and more efficient form of SFI.
%
Further, XFI uses a two-stack execution model to ensure verifiable
control flow integrity.
%The two-stack execution model used by Harbor to ensure module control flow
%integrity was motivated by XFI~\cite{xfi06osdi}, a high-performance variant
%of SFI.
%
XFI's scoped stack holds data accessible only in the static scope of
each function, including return addresses and most local variables.
%
A separate allocation stack stores data that may be shared within the
functions in a module.
%
The two-stack execution model used by Harbor for ensuring control flow
integrity within a module was motivated by XFI.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Safe OS Extensions}
%
Our work is also related to several other efforts in the
desktop/server space to isolate kernel modules such as device drivers,
either using hardware support (Nooks)~\cite{swift05nooks} or through type-safe
languages (SPIN)~\cite{spin95sosp} or software fault isolation
(exokernel)~\cite{exo97sosp}.
%
Nooks separates modules into lightweight protection domains by
managing separate page tables for each module.
%
Our approach is similar to Nooks in that it maintains memory ownership
information.
% and relies on standard interfaces to control flow and access of
% resources.
%
%=======================================================================
\subsection{Hardware-based Approaches}
%
We review the current state of the art in hardware based memory protection
and compare it with UMPU, our hardware-assisted fault isolation system.
%
\subsubsection{Memory Management Unit (MMU)}
%
Page-based virtual memory systems have become the dominant form of
memory management in the modern general-purpose computer systems.
%
The coarse granularity of page-based protection, its high performance
overhead, and its complexity does not make it popular in low-end
embedded microcontrollers.
%
%
\subsubsection{Memory Protection Units (MPU)}
\label{sec:mpu}
%
A Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is used to statically partition memory
and set individual protection attributes for each partition.
%
The partitions are contiguous segments within the address space
defined by a pair of base and bounds registers.
%
The most common protection attributes are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:armprotattr}.
%
\begin{table}[htdp]
\centering
\small{
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
	\hline
	Code & Mode Description\\
	\hline
        00 & No Access \\
        01 & Privileged Mode Access Only \\
        10 & Privileged Mode Full Access, User Mode Read Only \\
        11 & Full Access\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}}
\caption{ARM940T Protection Attributes Descriptions}
\label{tab:armprotattr}
\end{table}
%

The MPU protection model is not suited for embedded sensor
software running on low-end microcontrollers.
%
MPU defines only two protection domains, user mode and supervisor
mode.
%
This is sufficient for protecting the kernel from applications, but
not applications from one another.
%
The static partitioning of the address space into contiguous regions is
infeasible for the low-end microcontrollers with very limited memory
footprint.
%
Further, the number of partitions is also limited.
%

However, MPU has a lower memory footprint than UMPU because the
partitioning information can be stored in registers instead of
maintaining a memory map.
%
MPU introduces no performance overhead while UMPU incurs a single
clock cycle penalty for memory map accesses.
%
MPU's are used in embedded processors such as ARM
940T~\cite{arm940tds} and Infineon TC1775~\cite{inftc1775ds}.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Mondriaan Memory Protection}
%
Mondriaan Memory Protection (MMP)~\cite{witchel-asplos02-mondrian}
creates hardware enforced protection domains within a single address
space.
%
MMP inspects memory accesses at the instruction level from within the
processor pipeline to provide word-level protection.
%
MMP is designed for high performance desktop architectures and it uses
fairly complex and expensive hardware extensions to reduce overhead of
monitoring all accesses.
%
MMP also maintains a table of access permissions within memory for
every address space.
%
However, the tables are significantly larger that Harbor memory map as
MMP protection is more flexible and fine-grained.
%
Further, as chip area and cost are not dominant concerns, MMP
implements an expensive Protection Lookaside Buffer (PLB) to reduce
the overhead of checks introduced during memory accesses.
%
%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Hardware Accelerated Checkers}
%
Divya et al.~\cite{divya06ccured} propose a system that enhances the
CCured~\cite{ccured02necula} run-time checks by performing them in
hardware.
%
A group of \texttt{XCHECK} custom instructions are added to the
Xtensa~\cite{xtensads}, a customizable processor from Tensilica Inc.
%
The \texttt{XCHECK} instructions are inserted into the CCured modified
source code using a source transformation tool.
%
UMPU has a similar motivation; using hardware accelerators for
improving performance.
%
UMPU does not enforce type safety, but focuses on fault isolation.
%
Therefore, the hardware accelerated CCured and UMPU enforce different
properties that can improve the reliability of embedded software.

% SOS Background

%\section{Background --- SOS Operating System}
% \subsection{SOS Operating System}
% \label{sec:background}
% % 
% The initial motivation of our work was to provide memory protection
% for mote-class sensor nodes running the SOS operating system.
% % 
% % The design ideas of Harbor are generally applicable however its
% % implementation and evaluation are specific to SOS.
% % 
% We have implemented and evaluated Harbor's protection mechanisms on
% SOS, although the ideas should apply elsewhere.
% % 
% This brief introduction to SOS is useful to fully understand the
% implementation of our scheme.
% % 
% %===================================================
% %\subsection{SOS Operating System}
% % 
% %% Unique resource tradeoffs in the nodes, the distributed and
% %% collaborative nature of applications and the remote unattended
% %% operation of sensor networks motivate the design of a new class of
% %% operating system and run-times.
% % 
% TinyOS~\cite{levis05t2}, the most popular operating system for sensor
% networks, uses reusable software components to implement common
% services, but each node runs a statically linked system image.
% % 
% %% The components are written in the NesC~\cite{gay03nesc} programming
% %% language.
% % 
% %% Mat\'e~\cite{asvm05nsdi}, an application specific virtual machine
% %% on top of TinyOS provides limited flexibility to re-task a deployed
% %% network using high-level scripts.
% % 
% SOS has a more traditional architecture: a kernel is
% installed on all nodes, and
% % 
% % The rest of the system and 
% application level functionality is implemented by a set of dynamically
% loadable binary modules~\cite{ram05sos}.
% % 
% % In contrast to TinyOS, SOS maintains modularity at the binary level
% % without any loss in efficiency.
% % 
% % This property of SOS makes it particularly attractive to explore
% % techniques for isolating software faults.
% % 
% %% We have implemented the memory protection mechanism on the SOS
% %% operating system.
% % 
% %% The embodiment of the scheme is specific to SOS, however it can
% %% easily be applied to the other existing run-times as well
% %% (subsection~\ref{sec:conclude}).
% % 
% % any operating system that supports dynamically loadable binary
% % modules.
% % 
% % This brief introduction to SOS is useful to fully understand the
% % implementation of our scheme.
% % 
% % 
% % 
% The kernel is relatively well tested; we assume it is free of
% programming errors.
% % 
% Modules are position independent binaries that implement a specific
% task or function, and are less well tested by comparison.
% % 
% Modules operate on their own state, which is dynamically allocated at
% run-time.
% % 
% An application in SOS is composed of one or more modules interacting
% via asynchronous messages or function calls.
% % 
% Examples of modules are routing protocols, sensor drivers, application
% programs, and so forth.
%
%----------------------------------------------------------
% \subsubsection{Module Linking}
% \label{sec:soslinking}
% %
% Any SOS module is linked upon loading with the kernel and other
% modules in the system. 
% %
% %Modules communicate with one another through asynchronous message
% %passing or synchronous function calls
% %(Figure~\ref{fig:sos_mod_interactions}).
% %
% The SOS kernel provides a rich set of services such as software
% timers, networking, sensor I/O, etc., accessible via a system
% call API.
% %
% The kernel maintains a jump table in program memory that stores the
% addresses of system calls (Figure~\ref{fig:sosjmptbl}).
% %
% The modules are pre-linked to the jump table entries.
% %
% Thus they do not have to carry any linking information, which reduces
% their size.
% %
% This design also provides flexibility to change the kernel independent
% of the modules as long as the consistency of the jump table is maintained.
% %

% Modules are also linked with one another through function pointer
% pointers (Figure~\ref{fig:modinteract}).
% %
% Every module carries records that indicates the set of functions to
% which it wishes to subscribe (from the rest of the system) and the set
% of functions that it provides (for the rest of the system).
% %
% The dynamic linker tracks down and links all the provide-subscribe
% function pairs when a module is loaded.
% %
% \begin{figure}[htpb]
%  \centering
%   \mbox{
%     \subfigure[Jump Table for System
%     API]{\label{fig:sosjmptbl}\includegraphics[width=2in,

%     \hspace{0.2in}
%     \subfigure[Module

% %   keepaspectratio=true]{figures/jumptable.eps} 
% %   \caption{Jump Table for SOS Modules}
% %   \label{fig:sosjmptbl}
% % \end{figure}
% %----------------------------------------------------------
% \subsubsection{Message Passing}
% %
% The modules in SOS can communicate with other modules and the kernel
% through message passing.
% %
% SOS modules are implemented as message handlers as shown in
% Figure~\ref{fig:modinteract}.
% %
% The messages are annotated with the identity of the destination module
% and stored in a FIFO queue within the kernel.
% %
% The scheduler invokes a handler function in the destination module of
% a message.
% %
% During load time, the modules register the handler function with
% the kernel.
% %
% %All modules are required to implement a message handler.
% %
% The message handlers execute in the background context.
% %
% The background context comprises of operations that can only be
% interrupted by events occurring in the foreground context (for
% e.g. hardware interrupts).
% %
% %A module can invoke synchronous system calls in the kernel and
% %synchronous function calls in the other modules from a message
% %handler.
% %
% After a handler terminates, the execution control is transferred back
% to the scheduler.
% %
% SOS requires cooperative scheduling to share the processor between
% multiple executing modules.
% %
% %---------------------------------------------------------
% \subsubsection{Dynamic Memory Allocation}
% % 
% The SOS kernel supports dynamic memory allocation.
% % 
% Dynamic memory is used to store module state and to create messages to
% be dispatched to other modules. 
% % 
% Memory is allocated using a block-based first-fit scheme to minimize
% the overhead of the allocation process.
% %
% The size of the block is platform dependant and is 8 bytes for Mica2
% sensor node.
% % 
% Limited memory forces SOS kernel and user modules to share a common
% allocation heap; any static partitioning would be too conservative.
% % 
% % The dynamic memory is shared by the SOS kernel and the modules.
% % 
% The kernel therefore tracks ownership of memory blocks.
% % 
% A block's ownership can also be transferred, allowing
% % 
% buffers to pass easily through various modules in the system.
% 
% 
%====================================================================== 
% \subsection{System Components}
% % 
% Harbor's four components are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys_overview}.
% % 
% %% We first describe overall system operation.
% % 
% The system's input consists of raw user module binaries generated by a
% cross-compiler toolchain.
% % 
% The \emph{binary rewriter} is a desktop application that statically
% analyzes these binaries for potentially unsafe operations and inserts
% run-time checks to sandbox them.
% % 
% The sandboxed binary is then distributed to a network of sensor nodes.
% % 
% A \emph{verifier} running on each node verifies that incoming binaries
% are correctly sandboxed.
% % 
% Verified binaries admitted for execution interact closely
% with Harbor's run-time components, the \emph{memory map manager} and \emph{control flow
%   manager}.

%\subsection{Summary}
%
This section positions Harbor in the category of fault isolation
techniques for
resource constrained microcontrollers.
% with limited address space.
%
Harbor isolation is more fine-grained than other approaches for sensor
networks.
%
The design of Harbor, though motivated by systems in the
desktop/server domains, introduces new techniques that address the
embedded domain's constraints.
%
%Finally, the brief overview of SOS presented in this section is
%essential to completely understand the implementation details.
